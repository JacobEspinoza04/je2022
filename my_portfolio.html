  <h2>Kubuntu Virtual Machine</h2>
  <h2 id="title2">Spectrum V Project</h2>

  <div id="kubuntu">
    <p> I was able to create a my virtual machine by first learning the different parts of a computer and learning how to connect everything. Then I copued the Kubuntu operating system onto a USB. After that, I set up a computer, downloaded the Kubuntu file onto the computer and than ran the system to make sure the machine worked right. </p>

  <div id="spectrum">
    <p>I created my Spectrum V Project by first creating some new HTML, then in the "body' section, I added a table with a table row and five table decks inside that row with id's. Then in the CSS, I made each table deck a certain height and width, and with their was able to seperate each color by using margin in CSS to space each deck out.  </div>
